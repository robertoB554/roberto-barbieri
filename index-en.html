<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  My name is Roberto Barbieri, and Iâ€™ve spent over 50 years working in the field of technology and industrial innovation.
  Throughout my career, I held key roles as Technical Director and systems designer in both Italian and international companies, 
  leading multidisciplinary teams in the development of electronic systems, mechatronics, industrial automation, 
  and high-performance embedded devices. I began my career in the early 1970s in the electrical sector, 
  soon advancing into microelectronics and advanced automation.
</p>
<p>
  Over the years, Iâ€™ve managed complex projects such as high-precision measurement instruments, black boxes for electric vehicles (AGVs), 
  embedded medical devices, industrial weighing systems, and automated testing solutions. 
  I have deep expertise in hardware/firmware design, technical diagnostics, low- and high-level programming (Assembly, C/C++), 
  PCB design, data transmission, and sensor integration.
</p>
<p>
  I bring strategic vision and technical accuracy to every project, supporting both startups and established companies. 
  Even now, after retiring from full-time employment, I remain passionate about consulting, designing, and solving technical challenges. 
  I enjoy offering my expertise to those in need of a reliable, competent, and results-oriented technical guide.
</p>


<h2>Core Skills</h2>
<p>
  Throughout my career, I have developed broad and in-depth technical expertise, especially in hardware and firmware design 
  for embedded systems. I have worked with ARM architectures, FPGAs, and microcontrollers, delivering custom solutions 
  for industrial and high-reliability applications.
</p>
<p>
  Iâ€™ve designed and overseen complex automation systems, including autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), 
  medical equipment, and data transmission systems using fiber optics and cables. 
  My toolset includes Orcad, Autocad, and LTSpice, and I program in C, C++, and Assembly.
</p>
<p>
  Iâ€™m also highly skilled in technical diagnostics, sensor integration, managing multidisciplinary projects, 
  and solving complex challenges in both development and maintenance phases.
</p>


<h2>Projects Delivered</h2>
<p>
  I have led and delivered a wide range of technical projects, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>High-precision electronic measurement systems for laboratories and industrial environments</li>
  <li>Smart black boxes for electric industrial and civil vehicles with real-time monitoring</li>
  <li>Automated testing systems for high-efficiency production lines</li>
  <li>Embedded medical devices with onboard data processing</li>
  <li>Drive systems and controllers for various types and sizes of electric motors</li>
  <li>Peltier cell heat exchangers for precision applications</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each project was carried out with a strong focus on quality, cost optimization, and long-term reliability.
</p>

<h2>Why Choose Me</h2>
<p>
  My experience is not only extensive, but deeply rooted in real-world results: with over 50 years of hands-on work in
  electronics, automation, and industrial design, Iâ€™ve tackled every kind of technical challenge with measurable outcomes.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike many theoretical consultants, I deliver practical, reliable, and fully tested solutions. I work with precision,
  punctuality, and strong attention to detailâ€”always putting the client's needs at the center.
</p>
<p>
  If you're looking for a senior expert who can independently bring real value to your technical projects, 
  you're in the right place.
</p>
